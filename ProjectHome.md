GPU-accelerated backprojection for synthetic aperture radar imaging developed at the Ohio State University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in collaboration with the Department of Biomedical Informatics.

Dive right in:
  * the kernel: http://code.google.com/p/osubp/source/browse/PyCUDABackProjectionKernel.cu (read this)
  * the PyCUDA setup: http://code.google.com/p/osubp/source/browse/pythonBP.py (run this)

Upcoming:
  * tiling
  * double support
  * real-time code generation in PyCUDA
  * further analysis of the errors in output between Matlab and CUDA imagers
  * non-Matlab data loaders, pre-processors, and visualization
  * Matlab-only MEX interface

Required packages:
  * Python
  * CUDA
  * PyCUDA http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda
  * mlabwrap http://mlabwrap.sourceforge.net/
  * Matlab for data loading http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/

Recommended:
  * Sage http://sagemath.org/
  * Raw phase history GOTCHA public datasets: [GOTCHA Volumetric SAR Data Set](https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=gotcha) and [SAR-Based GMTI in Urban Environment Challenge Problem](https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=gmti) (please ignore "invalid SSL certificate" warning, and email SDMS asking them to fix it)
